# Technical Documentation

Welcome to LawLinkGlobal’s Technical Documentation. This documentation provides detailed technical insights into the architecture, blockchain integration, security mechanisms, and API references for developers integrating with LawLinkGlobal’s decentralized legal services platform.

---

## Platform Overview

LawLinkGlobal is built on a decentralized architecture leveraging the **Sui Network**, smart contracts, and wallet-based authentication to ensure secure and transparent interactions between users and verified legal professionals worldwide.

### Core Architecture Components:

- **Blockchain Network:**  
  - Built on [Sui Network](https://sui.io/).
  - Utilizes Sui’s unique object-based model for scalable, efficient transactions.

- **Authentication Layer (Wallet-based Auth):**  
  - Wallet addresses (e.g., Sui Wallet) serve as decentralized user and lawyer identities.
  - No centralized username/password storage, enhancing security and user privacy.

- **Smart Contracts & Escrow:**  
  - Written in [Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-move), Sui’s smart contract language.
  - Escrow smart contracts automatically manage consultation payments, refunds, and milestones.

- **Microservices:**  
  - Appointment Scheduling Service
  - Lawyer KYC Verification Service
  - Chatbox Communication Service
  - Real-time Currency Conversion Service (SUI to USD rates)
  - Notification & Support Service (P2P and Admin-support)

- **Encrypted Document Storage:**  
  - Temporary secure storage during KYC verification.
  - Documents permanently deleted post-verification approval.

## Blockchain & Smart Contract Details

LawLinkGlobal uses smart contracts extensively to automate and secure various functionalities:

### Escrow Contract Workflow:

- User schedules an appointment, payment is locked in escrow (SUI tokens).
- Upon successful completion (based on consultation checkpoint triggers), escrow releases payment automatically.
- If conditions are not met (e.g., lawyer absence), escrow refunds the payment.

### Lawyer Verification Contract:

- Admin wallet whitelists verified lawyer wallet addresses.
- Verification documents are encrypted off-chain and deleted post-approval, maintaining data privacy.

---

## Wallet Authentication Mechanism

- Wallet connection via browser extensions (e.g., Sui Wallet) or mobile wallets.
- Authenticated sessions managed through secure cryptographic signatures.
- Dashboard access restricted to verified wallet addresses (lawyers) or authenticated wallet connections (users).

---

## Data Handling & Security

LawLinkGlobal employs strict data security practices:

- **Data Minimization:**  
  Only essential data is retained temporarily (encrypted verification documents).
- **Encryption:**  
  Sensitive documents encrypted with AES-256 during transmission and temporary storage.
- **Automatic Deletion:**  
  Documents deleted immediately upon admin verification.
- **Decentralized Auth:**  
  No user passwords or personal data stored beyond verification necessity.

---

## APIs & Integration

LawLinkGlobal offers RESTful API endpoints for seamless integration with external services and extensions.

### API Endpoints Overview:

**Authentication API**
- `POST /api/v1/auth/connect-wallet`
- Wallet-based authentication and user session creation.

**Lawyer Search API**
- `GET /api/v1/lawyers`
- Search for verified lawyers by specialty, language, rating, availability, and more.

**Appointment API**
- `POST /api/v1/appointments`
- Schedule appointments, trigger escrow smart contracts.

**Calendar Management API (Lawyers only)**
- `GET /api/v1/lawyer/calendar`
- Manage and retrieve lawyer availability.

**Escrow Payment API**
- `POST /api/v1/escrow/payments`
- Securely handle escrow payments and track their status.

**Currency Conversion API**
- `GET /api/v1/currency/conversion`
- Real-time SUI to USD currency conversion.

**Support & Notification API**
- `POST /api/v1/support`
- Submit support tickets; notifications sent to admin dashboard.

*Detailed API specifications, authentication tokens, and example requests/responses will be available in an upcoming API Reference section.*
